    "language models to reason through tasks in a structured, step-by-step manner, similar to human \n",
    "thinking. Rather than generating isolated responses, a model using Chain of Thought builds on \n",
    "prior information, creating responses that follow a logical flow and ensuring a coherent, \n",

    "## Why Chain of Thought Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional LLM models, responses can sometimes feel disjointed or context-free, especially with complex questions. Chain of Thought addresses these challenges by adding a reasoning layer, allowing the model to generate more accurate and relevant responses. This logical progression offers key benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Coherence**: Responses follow a natural flow, making it easier for users to follow and engage with the conversation.\n",
    "2. **Context Retention**: By building on previous information, the model maintains context across multiple steps, crucial for handling complex questions.\n",
    "3. **Increased Accuracy**: Logical progression reduces the likelihood of irrelevant or incorrect information, enhancing the reliability of responses.\n"
